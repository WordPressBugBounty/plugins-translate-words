/**
 * CPFM Feedback — single entry point for the shared framework folder.
 *
 * Requires every module's class definition, each still guarded by its own
 * class_exists() check (so calling this twice, or a sibling plugin loading
 * a module first, is always safe). Loading a class does NOT wire any hooks
 * by itself - every module only activates once the host calls its own
 * cpfm_register()/cpfm_init(), same as before this file existed. A host
 * that vendored a PARTIAL copy of this folder degrades gracefully: a
 * missing module file is simply skipped, never fatal.
 *
 * INTEGRATION (any plugin, one call, from an is_admin() code path only):
 *
 *   if ( is_admin() ) {
 *       require_once __DIR__ . '/cpfm-feedback/class-cpfm-loader.php';
 *       CPFM_Loader::load();
 *   }
 *
 * DELIBERATE TRADE-OFF, host's own choice: every module here — including
 * the cron class — is loaded admin-only. A front-end page view never pays
 * for parsing any of this, but it also means an actual WP-Cron run
 * (wp-cron.php) is NOT an is_admin() request, so CPFM_Usage_Cron never
 * gets defined there either. A host that registers a scheduled event with
 * it (wp_schedule_event()) will find that event fires with no handler
 * attached — nothing happens, no error, no data sent. If a host needs its
 * cron to actually run in the background, call CPFM_Loader::load()
 * unconditionally instead (or only require cron/class-cron.php directly,
 * unconditionally, alongside this admin-gated call for everything else).
 *
 * This replaces the require_once + class_exists boilerplate that used to
 * be repeated at every module's own registration call site - it does NOT
 * replace those calls themselves. Each module's cpfm_register()/cpfm_init()
 * still needs the host's own config (translated strings, option names,
 * screens, hook names...) and stays exactly where it already is, deferred
 * to `init` where i18n requires that.
 *
